The **map** function takes 5 parameters. The value the range it falls into and then the desired range.

```javascript
console.log(map(10, 0, 10, 0, 100)); //100 Expected
```

This will return 100 because 10 is 100% between 0 and 10

This works by finding the percent and then matching that percent to a different value with the same percent but in the other range (ranges can have negative numbers).
