This function returns the pixel colors in either a 1 or 2 dimensional array

```javascript
const currentData = canvas.getPixelData('2D');
```

The singular parameter represents the return type of array being returned. If you chose '1D' as the array type you'll get a 1 dimensional array of pixel colors that goes from the top left to the bottom right. If you choose '2D' then it'll return a grid you can see with this:

```javascript
console.log(currentData[x][y]);
```

A 2D array works by poking at an array inside another array. A 'nested' array if you will
