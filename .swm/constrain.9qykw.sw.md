**Constrain** is a function that takes a value and the minimum and maximum. If the value is over the max then it floors it to the max, same with the minimum. This makes the value always in between these 2 values.

```javascript
console.log(constrain(10, 1, 5));
```

This code will log 5 because 10 > 5

This is good for keeping an object inside the canvas
