Canvas is a constructor that makes a blank HTML5 canvas to draw on

```javascript
const board = new Canvas(500, 500, Color(0));
```

The 1st parameter is the length and the second is the width of the canvas made. The 3rd parameter is the color of the canvas.

By default, if they're are no parameters passed, the canvas will default to 500x with a color of black
