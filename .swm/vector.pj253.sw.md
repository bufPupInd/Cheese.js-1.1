A vector is a position in space with an x and y. In this context it's in a 2D space.

```
const v = new Vector(100, 100);
```

The code above shows a new vector at 100, 100. The defaults for a vector is 0, 0. There are various functions to do math with a vector like .add, .sub, .mult, .div

**vector.add, sub, mult, and div** take another vector or number and do the respective mathematical operation. If you have RETURN in the second parameter then it'll return the value rather than edit the values of the variable

```javascript
console.log(v.add(2, RETURN)); //Expected 102, 102
console.log(v.sub(5, RETURN)); //Expected 98, 98
console.log(v.mult(3, RETURN)); //Expected 300, 300
console.log(v.div(2, RETURN)); //Expected 50, 50
```

The code above shows how a vector is changed on both sides if a single constant is entered and RETURN returns the value. If you got rid of the RETURN it will return the edited version but effect the others

```javascript
console.log(v.add(2)); //Expected 102, 102
console.log(v.sub(2)); //Expected 100, 100
```

You can pass another vector to change x by the other x and y by the other y

```javascript
const v1 = new Vector(100, 100);
const v2 = new Vector(2, 3);
console.log(v1.add(v2, RETURN)); //Expected 102, 103
console.log(v1.mult(v2)); //Expected 200, 300
```

**Vector.normalize** will normalize the vector to a magnitude of 1. The magnitude if the 3rd side of a right triangle with the other sides of x, y. You can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of any vector. This is useful in multiple scenarios .

```javascript
console.log(new Vector(10, 10).normalize(RETURN));
```

**Vector.reflect** will change the value of any specified axis (make it the opposite sign)

```javascript
const vect = new Vector(10, 9);
vect.reflect(X);
vect.reflect(Y);
console.log(vect); //Expected -10, -9
vect.reflect(Y); 
console.log(vect); //Expected -10, 9
```

**Vector.save** and **Vector.restore** will put the current state in memory and restore will make the vector the one in memory;

```javascript
const vect = new Vector(10, 20);
vect.save();
vect.x = 5; vect.y = 30;
console.log(vect); //Expected 5, 30
vect.restore();
console.log(vect); //Expected 10, 20
```

This code makes a new vector, saves it, logs it, restores it, and logs it

**Vector.flip** will flip the x and y of the vector. Vector.flip can also use the RETURN keyword and will instead of editing the values it will return the new values while not editing the others

```javascript
const vect = new Vector(10, 30);
console.log(vect); //Expected 10, 30
console.log(vect.flip(RETURN)); //Expected 30, 10
```
