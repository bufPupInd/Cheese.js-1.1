The current length and width of the canvas are stored in the variable it self and are usable with canvas.length and canvas.width.

```javascript
const dim = {x: canvas.length, y: canvas.width};
console.log(dim); //Expected 500, 500 on a deafault canvas
```

The measurement is in pixels and can be exceeded but nothing beyond that point will render
