**dist** is a function that returns the distance in between 2 points using basic trigonometry. It takes two x, y points with 4 parameters. x1, y1 and the second 2 are x2, y2.

```javascript
console.log(dist(1, 1, 2, 1)); //Expected 1
```

You can pass WHOLE as an additional, but optional, parameter to floor the number before returning.

```javascript
console.log(dist(1, 1, 2, 1, WHOLE)) //If output is not whole it will become whole
```
