The function **random** takes 2 numbers which is the range that the number can be inside of.

```javascript
console.log(random(0, 100)); //Random num from 0 to 100
```

You can use the **WHOLE** keyword to indicate that it will return a whole number, not decimal.

```javascript
console.log(random(0, 100, WHOLE)) //random whole number
```

**randomIndex** will pick a random element in any giving array. It's only parameter is the array from which to choose from

```
const arr = [0, 1, 2];
console.log(randomIndex(arr)); //Either 0, 1, 2 on random
```

**randomArray** takes a length, a minimum and a maximum for the numbers inside

```
const arr = randomArray(2, 0, 10); //Random array
```

This variable arr holds 5 random values from 0 to 10
